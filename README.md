# CBOW and Skip-gram Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram models, two popular techniques in natural language processing (NLP) for word embedding generation. These models are foundational components of tools like Word2Vec, which learn high-quality word representations from textual data.

## Why CBOW and Skip-gram?

CBOW and Skip-gram models are key methods for learning word embeddings due to their efficiency and effectiveness:

- **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):**
  - Predicts the target word based on its surrounding context (neighboring words).
  - Well-suited for smaller datasets as it averages the context, providing robust predictions even with limited data.

- **Skip-gram:**
  - Predicts surrounding context words given a target word.
  - Performs better with larger datasets and is more effective for capturing rare word relationships.

These methods are fundamental in NLP pipelines for transforming textual data into dense vector representations, enabling downstream tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

## Features

### 1. **Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation**
   - Comprehensive explanations of the CBOW and Skip-gram algorithms.
   - Step-by-step walkthrough of data preprocessing, model architecture, and training.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization and preparation of text data.
   - Creation of training datasets suitable for CBOW and Skip-gram models.
   - **Trimming Techniques:**
     - Removal of stopwords and rare words to reduce noise.
     - Application of sub-sampling to handle high-frequency words, ensuring balanced training data.

### 3. **Model Training**
   - Implementation of CBOW and Skip-gram models using Python.
   - Use of key machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Training loops with loss function calculations.

### 4. **Visualizations**
   - Graphical representation of loss trends over epochs.
   - Visualizations of the resulting word embeddings in 2D/3D space using techniques like PCA or t-SNE.

### 5. **Interactive Exploration**
   - Test the trained embeddings with interactive queries to find similar words.
   - Compare the performance of CBOW and Skip-gram on the same dataset.
